# Tracking Reputation is a PITA

We all know it's true. Who's to say if the Zhents like your characters, or if a pack of wererats harbors a secret resentment to the bard in your party for something they said at the pub last night? Who knows if Xanathar thinks your PCs have the right stuff, or if the Harpers think you're all a bunch of deep state operatives?

Load up the online tracker and we'll do it for you! 
- Assign Reputation Points
- Predict interactions 
- Set breakpoints for new quests 

Figure out how popular your characters are with the rep tracker. It's fun!

Styling? Where we're going, we don't need styling...
